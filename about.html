                    <p>If you know your <span>Greek mythology</span>,<br>
				    you might remember <span>Persephone</span>—the beautiful goddess of spring<br>
				    and harvest, and the queen of the underworld.<br><br>
				    According to legend,<br>
                        her story is the reason for the <span>shift in seasons</span>.</p>

				<div class="desc"><p>Persephone’s story left such a huge impact on<br>
				restaurateur <span>Jessie Roasa</span> that she decided to name her<br>
				newest food venture after the goddess.<br><br>
				After all, the restaurant,<br>
				which is located along Jupiter Street in Makati,<br>
				can be best described as a <span>seasonal kitchen</span>.<br><br>
				Simply put, this means that diners can expect the menu<br>
				to shift like seasons every now and then.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="filipino">
				<p>A seasonal kitchen might sound new to a Filipino crowd,<br>
				especially because we only have two seasons.<br><br>
				But what I want to allude to is that Filipino taste changes so fast.<br>
				The seasonality aspect does not only refer to the harvest or the products,<br>
				but it’s also dependent on the trend and<br>
				what’s in the market right now.<br><br>
				It’s very dependent on where everything gravitates towards,<br>
				 and I want to be able to glide with that.<br><br>
				It gives me enough flexibility but also enough of a<br>
				framework to be able to work with how everything’s changing.<br><br>

					<p>Upon entering <span>Persephone - A Seasonal Kitchen</span>,<br>

					colorful floral mural, an embodiment of Persephone<br>
					as the <span>deity of spring time</span>.<br><br>
					This splashy wall is a precursor to what people<br>
					can expect in their dining experience—one that is characterized by<br>

					<p>Persephone is not just a restaurant;<br>
					it’s a <span>passion project</span>.<br><br>
					Jessie has dipped her feet in all aspects of the<br>
					<span>food industry</span>. She has worked in various restaurants<br>
					and food publications, has done restaurant marketing,<br>
					and has even tried her hand at food styling<br>
					and food photography.<br><br>
					But her first love is <span>cooking</span>.<br><br>
					Even as a little girl, she was always into cooking.<br>
					During her junior term in <span>Munich</span>, she found herself<br>
					cooking Filipino food for all her German friends.</p>

					<p>Whatever time of day,<br>
					Persephone guarantees that you will have a ball.<br><br>
					Just as the goddess Persephone is associated<br>
					with the <span>switching of seasons</span>, the ambience at the<br>
					restaurant also transforms from <span>day to night</span>.<br><br>
					In the daytime, the bright and happy colors<br>
					give the place a <span>chill vibe</span>, making it an ideal place<br>
					for lunches with good friends. </p>

					<p>After dark, the venue looks<br>

					It’s an excellent joint to cap the day off<br>
					with a cocktail or have your fill of good food before<br>
					heading out to the club.<br><br>
					With a menu that’s colorful and constantly<br>
					changing, Persephone will keep you <span>marveling</span>,<br>
					<span>wondering</span>, and <span>constantly guessing</span>—which<br>
					isn’t a bad thing at all.</p>
